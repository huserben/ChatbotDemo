Chatbot
===========

What's a Chatbot?
	"Chat bots are computer programs that mimic conversation with people using artificial intelligence. They can transform the way you interact with the internet from a series of self-initiated tasks to a quasi-conversation."
	Alexa, Siri, Google Now

Why?
	"Why does anyone care about chatbots? They look like simple text based services… what’s the big deal?"
		Integrate into tools people already use (Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp etc.) --> "people are using messenger apps more than they are using social networks"
	Automate Workflows - Replace (partially) human intervention --> noone needed to take a call at pizza place

Bot Framework
- Overview (what's a bot technically) (image --> custom Visio)
	- NET/Node
	- REST API
- Connectors (image)
- Conversation (1:1, group)
- Dialog (image)
- FormFlow (build up model)

Example Project
- DevNetwork Bot
	Add new DevNetwork at Date
		DevNetwork contains number of Presentations
		Presentations has Title, Summary, Tags and Presenter
	--> Show Model	
	Cancel a DevNetwork (--> inform all users about it)
	
	Ask for next DevNetwork, ask when presentation about topic is (--> used in 2nd part with LUIS)

- Architecture/Create Project with Template, structure
	- Create new Conversation
		- Add dialog about adding new DevNetwork
			- Stacked Dialog --> add new Presentation
	

- Emulator

Live Coding

=============
Coffee Break
=============

Interpretation of Text/Machine Learning
- examples
	Different kind of writing styles
		--> check with audience, how to ask for next c# presentation

LUIS

Live Coding:
- Using LUIS

Deploying on Azure
